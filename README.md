# Talon-Fex
My first Programming project; it's a bot for discord in node.js

## How-To run an own clone of Talon Fex:
* Insert token in config.json at `"token": "`...`"`
* Insert your ID in config.json at `"suid": "`...`"`
* Insert your ID in commands.json at `"all": {
	 "permissions": [{
	 	 "users"`...`"
	 	 ...
	 	 ]}
	 	 }`
* Bot has to be in official Talon Fex Server or the id of home has to be changed to of a Server the Bot already joined
* assure node is installed on your computer/server
* on Linux start `bot.sh`
* on Windows start `bot.bat` (coming soonâ„¢)

==> Information about all joined guilds has to be added manually to guilds.json at the moment.
